Python scripts for ML model to generate global map of subsidence (~2 km rsoultion) induced by groundwater pumping. The scripts include codes for automatic data 
downloading (remote sensing and gridded), data preprocessing, involved statistical methods, ML model (random forest classifier), result analysis, and plotiing.
